javascript-ipv6
===============

Doesn't do much yet but I'd like it to be a useful library for manipulating IPV6 addresses in JavaScript.

Future functionality might include:

- Whether a given address is valid
- Whether one address is a valid subnet of another
- Number of subnets of a certain size in a given address
- What special properties a given address has (multicast prefix, unique local address prefix, etc.)
